### These are my notes.

I write them here to practice writing every day, and to train myself to think with more discipline. 
These are my topics: 

- Nonprofit management. Designing, launching, and managing enterprises that make the world a better place.
  
- Access to justice. Designing public places and processes that produce an experience of justice for everyone.
  
- Living a meaningful life. Making daily compounding decisions that result in the life experience I want to live.

> That’s why the philosophers warn us not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then training. For as time passes we forget what we learned and end up doing the opposite, and hold opinions the opposite of what we should.
