I can identify a work path I've followed during my adult years.  But I wouldn't call it a career. I didn't follow a professional path that already existed and was shown to me. 

When I look back on my work experiences, what I see is that I made choices based on what I felt I needed to do. I followed my curiosity, frustrations, fear, passion, and hopes. The work projects I engaged in were as personal as they were professional to me. 

I see a collection of projects in a trail or path, behind me. And I continue to contemplate options for new projects in front of me.
