### Permission

Start by getting their permission

### Your goal is to change them

What part of their culture are we trying to change, so they make the choices that we need them to make? What patterns of behavior and their supporting belief are we asking them to leave behind?Plan how to change their culture from peer-to-peer, not through you. The Goal is to change the patterns of behavior and their supporting beliefs of those who do not choose to support us.

###Offer them exclusive affiliation

Offer them affiliation to your group, reinforce their status, show them how you and they are the same types of people, how this is a place for them, offer them a connection to something they want to be connected to. Send affiliation signals that multiply and will attract more people seeking connection. Offer them exclusivity (not elite). 

### Tactic to change their behavior 

We change their CONCEPTS and BELIEFS, we show them how to INTERPRET information with them, and then we give them examples of how PEOPLE LIKE THEM take action.Our messaging has to have CONCEPTS and BELIEFS that they can use to REPLACE their current supporting beliefs.Our messaging has to include INFORMATION that is public and that they INTERPRET with current BELIEFS and leads to the current BEHAVIOR that we want to change.Our messaging has to have examples and suggestions of patterns of behaviors that would express the INTERPRETATION we are offering themSeth Godin's blog formula: "Don't do X. Do Y. Because if Z information, with Q belief, R is what it means. Instead, be part of OUR group." This strengthens the tribe and also is a way to connect with others and try to change them.
