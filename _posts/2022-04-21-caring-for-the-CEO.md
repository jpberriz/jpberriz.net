The CEO is there to take care of staff. 

Who takes care of a nonprofit's CEO?  The answer could be the Board of Directors. Because it's the group of people above the CEO with more authority and more responsibility in the organization. 

But when I've read and learned about what good Boards should do, I've never come across the mandate of taking care of the CEO. I've only seen hire - evaluate - fire, the CEO.

So, what is it?

Should we change the culture of nonprofit Board leadership?
