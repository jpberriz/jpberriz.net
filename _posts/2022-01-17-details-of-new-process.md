### Which direction should I take?
Generate small work, ideas, posts, in order to find bigger ideas, and essays?
Or work on my book, and share small traces and posts that derive from it? 

Austien Kleon suggests to work from small to big: 

> In *Show Your Work*!, I wrote that it was always my M.O. **to turn flow into stock**: tweets become blog posts that become book chapters that become books.
>   - Austin Kleon

Others, like Tim Grahl, suggest that while working on your bigger piece, you leave traces of it in smaller pieces.
