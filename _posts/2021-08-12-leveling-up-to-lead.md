Leveling up to lead is a privilege and a responsibility. When you lead, your decisions gain wider and deeper consequence. So does your responsibility for your decisions. 

The quality of your decisions is limited by the quality of your information, the breadth of your knowledge, and the analytical capacity that you have at the time. 

To level up and lead like the world needs you to (no pressure), you need to take on the responsibility of getting good at: 

1. Deep listening and observing. To gather as much useful and truthful information as you can. 
2. Continuous learning. To organize, understand, connect, and value the information you gather.   
3. Clear thinking. To analyze possibilities and make choices.
