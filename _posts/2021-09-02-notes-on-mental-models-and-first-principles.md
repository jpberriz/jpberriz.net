## Key concepts

A **first principle** is a proposition or an assumption on which true knowledge is based. In science, theories, methods, and laws are derived from first principles. Axioms and postulates are the first principles in mathematics.

> "In every systematic inquiry (methods) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements."   -- Aristotle

The opposite is **reasoning by analogy**: building knowledge and solving problems based on prior *assumptions*, beliefs and widely held *best practices* approved by majority of people.

**First principles thinking** asks: is it true?

**Reasoning by analogy** says it was done before, therefore, it is true.

There are many comparisons between analogous and first principles thinking. The [coach](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/#:~:text=A){:target="_blank"} and the play stealer, the [chef](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html){:target="_blank"}  and the cook, or the [architect](https://www.maray.ai/posts/the-guide-to-architects-career-path){:target="_blank"}  and the draftsman. You can see the hint. The former build something unique and the latter follow instructions.

A **cognitive map** is any visual representation of a person’s (or a group’s) mental model for a given process or concept. 

A **mind map** is cognitive map consisting of a tree that represents a central topic and its subtopics. 

A **concept map** is another type of cognitive map in which nodes represent concepts and are related through labeled, directed edges that illustrate relationships between them. 



## Methodologies

[Best source](https://www.maray.ai/posts/first-principles-thinking){:target="_blank"} 


### 1. Five Whys

[Wikipidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys){:target="_blank"} 

An example of a problem is: The vehicle will not start.

1. ***Why?*** – The battery is dead. (First why)
2. ***Why?*** – The alternator is not functioning. (Second why)
3. ***Why?*** – The alternator belt has broken. (Third why)
4. ***Why?*** – The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. (Fourth why)
5. ***Why?*** – The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (Fifth why, a root cause)



### 2. Questions method #1

1. Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?)
2. Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?)
3. Looking for evidence (How can I back this up? What are the sources?)
4. Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)
5. Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?)
6. Questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)




### 3. Questions Method #2

[Method source](https://benjaminstrusnik.com/blog/wealth/business/growth/first-principles-thinking/){:target="_blank"} 

1. Identify your goal
2. List the obstacles
3. Question these obstacles
4. Find your first principles by answering the questions



### 4. Generic parts technique 

There are two basic questions that you ask as part of this process:

1. Can it be broken down further?  
2. Does my description of the object imply a use?
