Stoic philosophy teaches us to recognize that there is [very little of our lives that is under our control](https://dailystoic.com/control-and-choice/){:target="_blank"}. Basically, we only control how we [interpret and react to the events in our lives](https://dailystoic.com/remember-you-dont-control-what-happens-you-control-how-you-respond/){:target="blank"}.  It also teaches to live with [death in mind](https://dailystoic.com/14-stoic-quotes-on-death/){:target="blank"}, and not make the assumption that you will live a long life. 

Genetics is now learning that our [genes can be modified by the trauma we experience](https://www.verywellhealth.com/intergenerational-trauma-5191638){:target="blank"} and passed down to our children, and that genes can be transmitted between species (that's called [horizontal gene transfer](https://www.britannica.com/science/horizontal-gene-transfer){:target="blank"}).

Does DNA define if I have an organ or not? Or three ears? 

If so, then so much of me, is not mine.

Is my genetic code almost as old as the planet?

Then, what I am, and who I am, is almost entirely out of my control.
