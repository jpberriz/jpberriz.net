[Ai Weiwei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_Weiwei){:target="_blank"} is currently China's most famous artist.  
My favorite quote of his is

> Life is art. Art is life. I never separate it.

I want to watch [his films](https://www.aiweiwei.com/){:target="_blank"} and [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgNTWESZufY){:target="blank"} of him when I get a chance.
