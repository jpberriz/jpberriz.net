[Ai Weiwei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_Weiwei) is currently China's most famous artist.

My favorite quote of his is

> Life is art. Art is life. I never separate it.

I want to watch [his films](https://www.aiweiwei.com/) and [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgNTWESZufY) of him when I get a chance.
