Note to self: 

My leadership style is based on the following two strategies:

1. Finding, accumulating, organizing, and implementing new technological knowledge in order to increase the capacity of a nonprofit to achieve it's mission. 
2. Constantly engaging in improvements efforts (Kaizen).  



When in a leadership position, be explicit about these strategies. Formally teach them, include them in the organization's values, embeds them in the organization's procedures, use them while problem-solving, until they will become part of the organization's culture.
