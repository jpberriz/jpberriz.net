This morning I went on a walk. During the walk, I was thinking about a book I read over the weekend about value creation and marketing. The book conveyed a principle, which I thought was right and would benefit my work (principle below)* I asked myself, how can I implement it in my work as a consultant? I thought of some action items, and I started putting some of them on my calendar while I walked. I also sent an email (voice dictation) to a client based on the book’s principle.

> Book’s principle: given today's saturated market, instead of selling your product or service, focus on sharing who you are and why you do what you do, this will lead to people buying from you because they are fans or aligned with you, and not so much because of your product or service (which they can probably get from someone else).
Book: Big Fish, by Caroline G. Nuttall

This is how I know (and love) to operate, and how I did my work at Blue Ridge CASA as well. 

1. I identify a solid principle that makes sense to me and fits what I need. 
2. I understand it the best I can.
3. I immediately start implementing it (this is a test). 
4. I observe what results it produces, and decide the results are worth the effort. 
5. I decide to ditch or keep the principle, or to try implementing it again, or keep part of it.  
6. If I keep it, I list tasks to create a system to continue to apply the system as automatically (with less effort) as possible.
