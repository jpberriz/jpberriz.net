> Masakatsu Agatsu - True victory is victory over oneself 

A lesson from *Morihei Ueshiba - the founder of the martial art Aikido*, the art of peace.

We practice aikido to learn to master ourselves, not to conquer others.

We do not seek to learn to defeat who attacks us. 

We seek to transform ourselves so that attacking us is futile.
