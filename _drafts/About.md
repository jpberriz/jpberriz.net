About

JP's work in Justice started when he went to law school in Venezuela, where he volunteered to 



and has a master's degree from Harvard, among other academic credentials. He lived in a refugee camp as a volunteer for the United Nations, where 



JP's career has been in social justice. He went to law school in Venezuela. He also has two master's degrees in Law; one from Harvard Law School, the other from Warwick University, England, and a diploma in International Development from the Institute of Social Studies, The Hague, Holland. He was able to do all that studying because he was awarded Fulbright, O.A.S. and Chevening scholarships. 



He has worked as an **international consultant** preparing, managing, and evaluating Human Rights, Access to Justice, Justice Reform, and Government Transparency projects for international organizations like the World Bank, and the Pan-American Development Fund. 



He lived in a refugee camp as a participant of a United Nations program, helped write a refugee bill, and create a Refugee Assistance Program within his University. 



Before his job at CASA, he worked mostly as an independent consultant in justice, development and innovation. His clients included the World Bank, the United Nations, the Pan American Development Foundation and the Supreme Court of Venezuela. 

Fun fact: during 2014 JP was a member of the GrooveCat Improv comedy group in Staunton, which he misses very much.
