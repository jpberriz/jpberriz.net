# Origin Story

## As new Executive Director, I needed a comprehensive understanding of my organization so that I could manage all its moving parts as a system. 

In January 2015, I started a new job as the Executive Director of a small nonprofit organization in Virginia. The mission and work of the nonprofit was within my area of expertise. But I had not been an Executive Director before. I had worked as a consultant on international development projects, as a grassroots lawyer, a college lecturer, and as a social entrepreneur. But not as a nonprofit Executive Director. 

I felt that I had skills, passion, and subject-matter knowledge, but I was not familiar with nonprofit management practices, and the organization I had committing to leading needed a lot of re-building in order to achieve its mission. 

I needed a tool that would help me look at my organization as a whole, so I could know *what* parts of it needed to be worked on, decide *which* part needed to be worked on first - how to prioritize the focus on my energy, and then *how* to improve each organizational area. I also needed a tool to communicate to my staff and Board the situation of the organization and how I thought we were going to go about improving things.

As new Executive Director, I needed a comprehensive understanding of my organization so that I could manage all the moving parts of the organization, as a system. I needed to know for sure that I was not missing something important.

## I couldn't find any books or online courses that offered a comprehensive nonprofit management approach. 

I searched for books and online courses that could give me  a comprehensive nonprofit management approach, but couldn't find any. Most nonprofit management literature and resources addressed specific nonprofit topics separately from one another, as if they were disconnected "chunks" of practices, that didn't necessarily work together. 

------

## I turned to for-profit resources for answers on how to run my nonprofit. 

I decided to turn to for-profit resources for answers on how to run my nonprofit. Given that there are many more sources of for-profit business knowledge than for nonprofits, this seemed like a good idea to me.  I decided I would only take from for-profit knowledge what I thought would help me increase the quality of the results that my organization produced for the people we served. 

------

## I used Josh Kaufman's Personal MBA as a foundation.

A resource that offered a comprehensive yet simplified approach to basic concept and principles, was a for-profit business book that I was familiar with, [The Personal MBA](https://personalmba.com/) by [Josh Kaufman](https://joshkaufman.net/).  

In the Personal MBA, Josh Kaufman uses this concept of business: "a repeatable process that creates and delivers something of value, that other people want or need, at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that satisfies the customer’s needs and expectations, so that the business brings in enough profit to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation."

He then defines the 5 parts of a business the following way:

1. **Value Creation** - Discovering what people need or want, then creating it. 
2. **Marketing** - Attracting attention and building demand for what you’ve created. 
3. **Sales** - Turning prospective customers into paying customers. 
4. **Value Delivery** - Giving your customers what you’ve promised and ensuring that they’re satisfied. 
5. **Finance** - Bringing in enough money to keep going and make your effort worthwhile, and decide how to best use your limited time and resources in the future.

## I compared for-profit business concepts one at a time to my own practice as nonprofit Executive Director.

Kaufman's approach to a business concept had certain advantages, especially when compared with other business books. His concept of business was benign, in the sense that it was focused more on creating value for other people, rather than about making a profit at all costs. In the Personal MBA he states that "the purpose of every business is to make someone’s life a little bit better in some way", and that "the best businesses in the world are those that create the most value for people". Kaufman's approach felt right to me, and a close fit to my nonprofit work. 

In fact, it opened my mind to the idea that a nonprofit can be referred to as a business. A nonprofit business. To me, "business" would be the term used to reflect that an enterprise was rationally organized, and functioned with discipline and in a particular way in order to achieve its purpose. This is regardless if its purpose is to distribute a profit among owners or shareholders, or if it is to advocate for abused and neglected children.

Another advantage of the Personal MBA was that it deconstructed what a business is and how it operates. It breaks down the bundled or compounded idea of a business, removing many of the cultural interpretations of what a business "should" be, and delivers its conceptual building blocks. This allowed me to compare one for-profit business conceptual building block at a time to my own practice as a nonprofit Executive Director. I could take each single concept, test and experiment applying it to my work and then learn from that experience how to adapt it to nonprofit work.

And, of course, most importantly, it covered all the important parts of a business. As new Executive Director, I had finally found a tool that would allow me to gain a comprehensive understanding of my organization so that I could manage all its moving parts as a system.

## I adapted Kaufman's business concepts to my practice as nonprofit Executive Director, and added some ideas that I felt were missing.

I began using Kaufman's business concept and it's parts to organize my thinking and work as Executive Director. His "model" wasn't a perfect fit for my work, but it was still very useful.  It helped me understand that there are fundamental activities that any type of organization has to engage in to be successful, and that if any of these activities are not carried out, success cannot be achieved. That seemed very reasonable to me. At least as a starting point. 

As I went on doing my job, I adapted Kaufman's business concepts to my practice as nonprofit Executive Director, and I also had to add some ideas that I felt were missing.  

For example, Kaufman's model was built around the idea that a business is a series of processes. I found that while that was true, investing time and energy in my staff and volunteers was crucial for my nonprofit to be successful. But Kaufman's model didn't include a team of people as a fundamental part of a business, so I added the organization's people, its team, as a core business element. 

I also changed the order of Kaufman's business' parts. I think it makes sense for a for-profit to have "Finance" as the last part of a business process sequence because profit is frequently considered the ultimate test of success of a for-profit business. But I moved "Finance" into a new category called "Operations" in which I also incorporated other things, like infrastructure management, and IT management. For my organization, finances are extremely important, but not the last process or part of our business. 

Another change was the language. For example, the term "Sales".  It is possible, and even useful, to understand the idea that a nonprofit business needs to convert prospects into customers. That's what we do when we convert a potential donor or volunteer, into a committed one. But the word "Sales" felt foreign to our culture, as well as to the culture of donors, volunteers, and partner nonprofits. I changed it to "Engagement". Kaufman's business part called "Value Delivery" was very useful to understand that our Program was how we delivered value as a nonprofit.  Since the term "Program" is so common in nonprofit language and culture, I replaced "Value Delivery" for "Program" and placed it last in our business processes. For similar reasons, I substituted "Value Creation" for "Purpose" and "Marketing" for "Outreach".

It also made sense to change the name of these "business parts" or "processes" to something that reflected how interconnected and people-centered these elements were from my perspective. I decided to call them "Core Functions".  Like individual pieces of a system in which each part has a function.  Each Function is a business activity that must be carried out by a nonprofit's staff or volunteers.

## I developed my own nonprofit business management model to fit my needs as Executive Director.

Inspired by the Personal MBA, I developed my own  comprehensive, interconnected, and systemic approach to nonprofit management to fit my needs as Executive Director.

My model identifies six core business functions for a nonprofit. A nonprofit core business Function is an intended and purposeful set of activities necessary for a nonprofit business to operate successfully. Implementing these core business Functions gets you closer to achieving your mission. 

> **A nonprofit core business Function is an intended and purposeful set of activities necessary for a nonprofit business to operate successfully. Implementing these core business Functions gets you closer to achieving your mission.** 

 These are the Nonprofit Business Core Functions, and their meaning:

1. **Purpose**: identifying a valuable solution to a problem, and making it our mission to deliver it.
2. **Outreach**: capturing the interest of the people whose support we want for our mission.
3. **Engagement**: cultivating long-term commitments of support for our mission. 
4. **Operations**: continuously optimizing the resources our team needs to deliver our solution.
5. **Team**: retaining and developing the best people to deliver our solution.
6. **Program**: repeatedly delivering the valuable solution we committed to.

Functions are interconnected to each other. They are interdependent. A nonprofit is a system. Taking action in one area has an effect in another.

Each of these core business Functions contains Components, which nonprofit managers can carry out through a series of Activities, and also understand how they function by learning key Concepts.

## There are advantages to using this nonprofit business model. 

Whether you are an Executive Director, a Board Member, or another type of nonprofit manager or executive, here are some advantages to using this nonprofit business model as a comprehensive approach to understanding and managing a nonprofit business:

------

## You will develop discipline in your nonprofit business and management thinking.  

Having a comprehensive approach will help you develop discipline in your nonprofit business and management thinking.  As different management issues arise daily you can use this system to categorize it. And once categorized, you will know what type of questions to ask in order to dig deeper and discover the root of the problem, and identify a better solution.  

For example, a staff member came to me once to share an issue she was having with a volunteer she supervised, keeping the model in mind allowed me to ask questions to uncover if the issue was an outreach, team, or purpose issue. Are we focusing on attracting a type of volunteer profile that is not ideal for our work? (Outreach Function issue); or does my staff need more training on volunteer management? (Team Function issue); or are we asking volunteers to do things that are not a good fit for a volunteer vs. a paid position (Planning Component of the Purpose Function).

## You will make decision with more clarity.

The nonprofit business model offers support to your decisions, reasons to make them.

------

## You will use a common business language to communicate *why* you made a decision. 

You can also use the model as a framework to share with staff, board members, and volunteers, so you can all use a common language, and  concepts. It can help you communicate the context or the "why" of your decisions to your team or constituents. 

For example, in my nonprofit, we really depended on the long-term commitment of volunteers. I had Program staff whose job was to supervise volunteers while they carried out projects that could last up to 18 months. Once a volunteer was finished with a project, after a short break, we wanted them to take on another one. My Program staff saw their role exclusively within the Program Function. So when the time came to ask a volunteer to take on another project, they would send an email to the volunteer and ask if they wanted another project. I used the model to explain to them that they also had a role in the Engagement Function, and they needed to cultivate a long-term multi-year commitment from their volunteers that spanned over several Projects, and that an email was not the best way to make such a big ask from their volunteers, they needed to engage them with a better strategy and tool.

## You will have a powerful planning tool. 





You will build strategies and define tactics that make sense to your organization.



------

## You will choose the right tools.

The nonprofit business model tells you *why* you need to reach out to potential supporters, and that Outreach means to "capture the interest of people whose support you want for your mission". This will help you choose the right tool and  

In the nonprofit world, we are in a hurry to achieve results. Our passion for achieving the change we want to cause in the world feeds that rushed energy.  This rush often pushes us to find *how to* tools very helpful. There are a lot of messages out there telling us that their tool will help us achieve solid results if we buy it from them. We feel pressured to try to apply the latest thing, or the most recommended one. We buy-in these tools without a full understanding of the conceptual foundation of their purpose. This rush, and our choice to use these tools - for which we don't master their conceptual foundation - lowers the quality of our work. 

For example, strategic planning is the widely recommended activity that nonprofits are told they need to do. We take this pressure and search the internet on *how to* do strategic planning, and download the tool we feel more comfortable with, or we hire a consultant to do a strategic planning process with us and our Board. Approaching strategic planning like this will most likely lead to a flawed process, a waist of time and money, and a resulting strategic plan that will not be used. 

------

## You will increase your nonprofit's capacity.



------

## You will continue to get better at your job.

Learning by doing is the most effective way of learning that I know of. It does several many steps and time, and it is not easy. It requires being organized and disciplined. Basically, it involves testing or experimenting with an idea, concept, or process in your daily work, listening openly to feedback, and being very thoughtful about the results you get.   

First, you need to isolate and clearly identify what idea or practice you are testing or experimenting with. It is always better to exteriorize what you are testing, don't just keep it in your mind, but actually write it down. Then, you put it into practice, and gather feedback, observe the results you get. Analyze them.  

This process will make you a much more effective Nonprofit Manager than an MBA or an MNA.
