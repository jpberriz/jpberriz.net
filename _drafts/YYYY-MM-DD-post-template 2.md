This [SSIR article on Participatory Granmaking](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/participatory_grantmaking_is_your_future){:target="_blank"} opens in a new tab 

Reading this article about making grants without participation of the people you are trying to help with your grant, reminds me of the process of [human-centered design](https://www.ideo.com/post/design-kit), and of the discussion of down-up social and economic development, participatory democracy, the idea of [agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(sociology)) and the idea of development as freedom from Amartya Sen. 

This is really not a new idea, or issue.

It's a problematic behavior that well-intentioned donors continue to carry out.  

The principle behind all of this is empathy. When we do something for someone, without connecting with them (empathy), we miss the mark, we mess up.
