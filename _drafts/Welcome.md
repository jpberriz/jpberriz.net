## Welcome to the NonProfit.MBA

## The NonProfit.MBA origin story

In 2015, I was new to the role of Executive Director. The nonprofit I was taking over was in bad shape. I needed a comprehensive understanding of my organization so that I could manage all its moving parts as a system. I couldn't any models, so I turned to a for-profit resource for answers: Josh Kaufman's [Personal MBA](http://personalmba.com).  I experimented and adapted Kaufman's business concepts to my practice as Executive Director, and also added some of my own ideas. I eventually developed my own nonprofit business management model to support my work as Executive Director.  

I eventually developed my own nonprofit business management model to support my work as Executive Director. 

I will be sharing with you here the details of the nonprofit business model and other tools that helped me in my work as Executive Director, with the hope that they will help you as well. 

## How does this benefit you?

If you are a nonprofit Executive Director, Board Member, or another type of nonprofit manager or executive, using my nonprofit business model can help you:

- Develop discipline in your nonprofit business and management thinking.  
- Make decisions with more clarity.
- Share a business language to communicate to your team *why* you made a decision. 
- Ease organizational planning: defining goals, building strategies, and defining tactics that make sense for your organization.
- Choose tools based on business needs.
- Increase your nonprofit's capacity.
- Continue to get better at your job as nonprofit manager.

- I hope it becomes a reference manual for every nonprofit Executive Director and manager.  
- A series of in-person NonProfit MBA workshops.
