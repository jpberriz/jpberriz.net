I was trained as a lawyer, and  taught a methodology... to look at real life situations, recognize its elements of legal consequence, and identify the corresponding legal rules that apply to that situation. 

In fully modern societies we live within legal and social constructs that are rooted in our culture. In this context, this methodology allows a lawyer to make a living. The lawyer serves as a go-between the law and people.

But this methodology does not work in societies that have a modern legal system and a pre-modern or hybrid culture. The miss-match between the values protected by the law and the value system of people's culture distorts the role of the lawyer.

Which lawyers can navigate that culture? What lawyers can facilitate justice in within that miss-matched cultural setting? What institutions make sense? What order can be built? What law can be taught and practiced?

The methodology I was taught at law school does very little to help navigate these problems.
