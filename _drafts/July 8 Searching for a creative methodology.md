I was trained as a lawyer, I was taught a methodology... to look at real life situations, recognize  elements of legal consequence, and identify the corresponding legal rules that apply to that situation. 

In fully modern societies we live within social constructs that are rooted on legal rules. In this context, this methodology allows a lawyer to make a living. The lawyer serves as a go-between the law and people.

But this methodology does not work in societies that have a modern legal system and a pre-modern or hybrid culture. The miss-match between the values protected by the law and the value system of people's culture distorts the role of the lawyer.

Which layers can navigate that culture? What layers can facilitate justice in that culture? What institutions make sense? What order can be built? What law can be taught and practiced?

Professionally, the methodology proved very limited to navigate these problems. 

Personally, I found that this methodology was didn't help think, create, and share what I was able to do, produce, create.
