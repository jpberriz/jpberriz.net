The new years is widely celebrated. It's celebration is a world-wide social ritual. 

It symbolizes the beginning of something new. We undertake celebratory rituals where we commit to changing into something better, whatever that is for us. We say goodby to the previous year, and we put it in the past. We declare the new year - "this year" - as our present.  

This makes no sense to me. 

As rational individuals we are able to make such commitments to change at any day of our lives.

Why do it on January 1st?

There is a connection between our calendar and repetitive events of celestial objects, planet Earth, the moon, and the soon  

Why does a new year start on January 1st?

A day is connected to the rotation of our planet, Earth, on its own axis. 

Is a month connected to the moon's revolution around Earth?

A year is connected 



**A calendar**

A **calendar** is a particular system for dividing time into periods such as years, months, and weeks, often starting from a particular point in history. The Christian calendar was originally based on the Julian calendar of the Romans. https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/calendar

A celestial event https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_event



Ideally, a day is tied to a rotation of the earth, a month to the revolution of the moon around the earth, and a year, the revolution of the earth around the sun.  



**A day**

This stuff can get really complicated. If you deep-dive into what you can read on the internet, it get's dense soon.

Basic facts:

A day is the length of time it takes for Earth to spin on its own axis. So, it's duration is tied to a celestial event.

*Duration of a day*

And that's 24 hours, right? Nope. It's [23 hours and 56 minutes](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/days/en/#:~:text=Another%20way%20to%20measure%20a,23%20hours%20and%2056%20minutes).

According to https://www.timeanddate.com/time/earth-rotation.html ...

>  "[Modern timekeeping](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html) defines a day as the sum of 24 hoursâ€”but that is not entirely correct. The Earth's rotation is not constant, so in terms of [solar time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/local-mean-time.html), most days are a little longer or shorter than that.

> In past decades, the Earth's average rotational speed has consistently decreased, so most days were a little longer than 24 hours. Recently, however, our planet has been [spinning faster again](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/earth-faster-rotation.html), making for slightly shorter days."

*Side-note on the earth's rotation*

It's inner core is made out of a ball of iron about the size of the moon that is floating in a liquid metal ocean, which allows it to turn independently and in a different direction from the earth's spin, a phenomenon known as super-rotation.

*Side note on the names of the days*

From http://www.beaglesoft.com/timehistoryroman.htm

Sunday = Sun's day

Monday = Moon's day

Tuesday = Mars' day 

Wednesday = Mercury's day

Thursday = Jupiter's day 

Friday = Venus's day

Saturday = Saturn's day









*Why do days start at midnight?*

because it's the opposite of noon

If noon is when the sun is highest, 

I found a good explanation here

**A month**

Is a month the length to time it takes the moon to orbit the Earth?

It used to be. 

The moon orbits the Earth once every 27.322 days. 

Note: As explained [here](https://www.space.com/24871-does-the-moon-rotate.html) the moon also rotates on its own axis in 27 days, which is why we mostly only see one side of it from Earth.

This is the explanation by Astronomer Jagadheep D. Pandian, Ph.D [link](http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/125-observational-astronomy/timekeeping/calendars/765-why-are-most-months-30-or-31-days-long-intermediate#:~:text=If%20it%20takes%20the%20Moon,has%20resulted%20from%20a%20compromise.&text=This%20forced%20some%20days%20to,was%20made%20a%20leap%20year)

> This has resulted from a compromise. Initially, months were mostly 29 days long and the average length of a month was 29.5 days which is the time taken by the Moon to orbit the Earth. However, this resulted in a year of only 354 days while the orbital period of the Earth is 365.2422 days. As a result, the calender became out of sync with seasons which was bad. This was initially corrected in an arbitrary way by adding a 13th month, but soon the calender was thrown into severe confusion.
>
> In 46 B.C., Julius Caesar reformed the calender by ordering the year to be 365 days in length and to contain 12 months. This forced some days to be added to some of the months to bring the total from 354 up to 365 days. To account for the extra 0.2422 days, every fourth year was made a leap year. This made the average length of a year to be 365.25 days. 



This means that a calendar month is a bit longer than the moon's full revolution around the earth.







**Why does the new year start January 1st?**

I found contradictory arguments, or different stories. 

I'll list the link below so you can do a deep dive if you wish. 

While initially (years BC) the start of the year was decided it should correspond with celestial events and their effect on the length of the day on Earth and [solstice](https://www.space.com/what-is-a-solstice.html).  Most answers below mention Julius Caesar (46 BCE)

**So what?**

It makes much more sense to me to make commitments to change on our birthdays.

It also makes more sense to connect with our perception and experience of movement of the sun and the moon in order to measure our lives, rather than a clock or calendar. 

Obviously, as a social norm, the calendar and the clock, are useful and unavoidable. Living a different time system isn't possible. 

But being aware of a more natural time system, and where I am in it, 

Awaking or being awake at sunrise can give you a powerful feeling of connection to nature.  

But I think it is fair to recognize how these systems and artifacts are are disconnected from nature and
