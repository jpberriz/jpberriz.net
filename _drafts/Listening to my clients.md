# Listening to my clients

Innovation phase: exploring.

I attended a meeting of a different organization as a member of an advisory board that represents the organization's clients.  Several client representatives were stating that clients didn't feel listened to by staff . Communication wasn't as frequent as they needed, and when something was going wrong in the delivery of services, clients didn't feel it was easy for them to communicate issues and feel they were heard and there concerns were tended to.

At some other moment during the meeting, the organization's leader referred to their difficulties with retention of clients. 

I found myself asking: "Do you systematically collect information from clients that choose to stay with you over the years, as well as clients that decide to leave you? You could do this easily with an online survey sent to clients every year (when decision to stay or leave occurs), and follow up with an interview if appropriate. That would allow you to have aggregate data that would tell you why people chose to stay or leave your organization, which would also inform your sales/recruitment team whom to target as new clients."

In the past, while we have spoken about it, I hadn't recognized the power of having a system like this in place in my own organization. 

The goal is to setup a system where clients are asked the right questions regarding their choice to purchase or not the value that we can create and deliver to them.
